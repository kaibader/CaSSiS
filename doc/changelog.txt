CaSSiS 0.3.3 (internally released 24.October 2011; maintenance release)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following items were fixed and/or added:

  structure.

  version.

* Applied some fixes that should reduce the memory consumption.
* Added log messages during runtime. Disabled by default.
* Various modifications that are necessary to support "outgroup matches" in
  CaSSiS-LCA.
* Added a RMQ implementation to CaSSiS-LCA.
* Removed obsolete code from the PT-Server.
* Refactoring: species --> sequence.
* Added 'make package' by adding CPack.
* Various updates/fixes to the pthreads support. Untested and disabled by
  default.
* Disabled a PT-Server warning that resulted in gigabytes of output.
* Fixed a double free when computing signatures of different lengths.
* Added the MiniPT tool for PT-Index debugging.
* Added basic Base4Set merge support. Untested.
* Added VarInt support to the BGRT tools.
* Removed redundant code.


CaSSiS 0.3.2 (released 12.August 2011; stable release)
------------------------------------------------------
The following items were fixed and/or added:

* Fixed parameter handling. Fixed help in CaSSiS.
* Disabled various unimplemented functions.
* Optimized the BGRT layout.
* Added "Creme de CaSSiS" (CdCaSSiS), a user interface version of CaSSiS.
* Removed the outdated unit tests. (Not visible to the end user.)
* Removed the outdated statistics code.
* Removed various warnings during compilation.
* Various small improvements. (Too small to be mentioned in detail.)
* Removed obsolete ARBHOME environment variable dependency.
* Reduced the code complexity a bit.
* Small update that might speed up the PT-Server a little bit.
* Removed proprietary memory management from the PT-Server.
* Fixed three memory leaks (in the PT-Server and the ARB-DB code).

  CaSSiS.
* Added ARB files to the repository. Created a project-specific ARBDB
  library.
* Directly added the PT-Server (former ARB PT-Server) to CaSSiS. This code does
  no longer match the original ARB PT-Server code.
* Various changes due to strict gcc settings.
* Added date/version numbers to the cmake files and the source code.
* Updated the documentation.
* Switched to templates for internal types.


CaSSiS 0.3.1 (released 27.June 2011; maintenance release)
---------------------------------------------------------
The following items were fixed and/or added:

* Fixed minor dependency problems in the shell scripts.


CaSSiS 0.3.0 (internally released 9.June 2011; stable release)
--------------------------------------------------------------
The following items were fixed and/or added:

* Added/updated the documentation.
* Fixed various memory leaks / minor bugs.
* Added I/O functionality for Base4Set and Base4_t. Added Base4 type
  functionality.
* Added the Base4 support throughout the BGRT library, resulting in less
  memory consumption.
* Various changes to reduce the memory consumption of a loaded BGRT.
* Implemented a new (slightly faster) traversal approach.
* Updated the CaSSiS PT-Server code due to ARB source code updates. Updated
  the ARB PT-Server dependencies.
* Clean-up does not remove computed BGRT-files any longer.
* Adapted the batch job script according to the new parameters.
* Split the CaSSiS functionalities into three different functions:
  create / traverse / info
* Updated the parameter parser function.
* Set a dummy ARBHOME environment variable to satisfy the PT-Server.
* Added branch lengths to the phylogenetic tree.
* Moved thermodynamic functionalities into the BGRT library.
* Added single group search to the BGRT library.
* BGRT file checksum added.
* Updated phylogenetic tree reduction.
* Removed progress bar from phylogenetic tree reader.
* Disabled dump stats by default.
* Refactored the CSV result dump.
* Updated the BGRT filename generation.
* Renamed all referenced probe(s) to signature(s)
* Updated the BGRT library (separate base types)
* Updated the output. BGRT header information is now dumped when loading a
  BGRT.
* Code moved from C to C++.
* Major changes in the handling of the BGRT file. BGRT structures can now be
  stored/loaded.


CaSSiS 0.2.0 (released 7.March 2011; stable release)
----------------------------------------------------
The following items were fixed and/or added:

* Updated the error handling within CaSSiS.
* Updated/fixed an error in the mismatch calculation.
* Fixed the mismatch parameter parsing.
* Support of weighted mismatches (ARB PT-Server functionality).
* Various preparations for the usage of thermodynamics (G+C,
  melting temp, ...) during the BGRT build process.
* Updated the PT-Server+BGRT to count outgroup matches between m1 and m2.
* Code clean-up. Updated to the newest ARB code base. Code split into three
  libraries (libCORE.so, libARBDB.so and libptserver.so).
* Removed obsolete output (status messages) in the release build.
* Updated the batch job script: Removed the PT-Server name parameter because
  it is obsolete.
* Minor fix to correctly sync. the ids between CaSSiS and the PT-Server.
* Fixed a bug when using mismatch distances > 1.
* Added an ARB PT-Server wrapper. No need for a PT-Server binary any longer.
* The BGRT functionality is combined in a dynamic library: libbgrt.so
* Fixed ID handling for phylogenetic trees that only contain a subset of the
  sequences within the BGRT.
* Swapped the processing order of the BGRT and phylogenetic tree.
* Memory leak fix.
